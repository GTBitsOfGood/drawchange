    <h3>Volunteering at drawchange</h3>
    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in volunteering with us!
      You can volunteer to help us with a specific project,
      event, going to the homeless shelters with us or helping
      us out around the office. Whatever it is, you are
      guaranteed to leave with a full heart and ear to ear smile!
    </p>
    <p>
      While we greatly need and appreciate all of the volunteer
      assistance we receive, we do not have a full time volunteer
      manager on staff. Thank you in advance for understanding
      that your application may take a few weeks to get processed.
    </p>
